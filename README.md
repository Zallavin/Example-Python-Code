Just a few Maya scripting examples

The Lip_Eyebrow_Node_Setup.py script is basically one of the scripts I used to setup the joint behavior of a curve driven facial setup more quickly.

The SnapSwitch.py is a small tool for animators to fluently switch between IK and FK limbs without having any popping effects in the limbs. For me this was basically to test ways to avoid for example that pole vector controls disapper in the 3D-mesh, by using simple vector math and composing matrices.
